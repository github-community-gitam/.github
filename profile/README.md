# This is GitHub Community GITAM
We’re GitHub Community GITAM, a passionate student-led tech club that started in June 2022. With over 900 members and 70+ events under our belt, we’re all about building, learning, and growing together. From hackathons and hands-on workshops to open-source sprints and design jams, we create real opportunities for students to explore what excites them. Our club brings together curious minds in web, app dev, AI/ML, UI/UX, and competitive coding. We’ve also teamed up with global platforms like GitHub Education, GSoC, and MLH to take our learning beyond the campus.
